# scala-docker

`sbt docker` - buiild docker image

`docker run -v /c:/mateusz/ mateusz/scala-docker:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT /mateusz/{path to your harvest file} /mateusz/{path to your prices file}` - run docker container 

To provide an actual solution I guess I should turn some columns into lists, and use list functions to transform them and perform computations. 

To little time to figure it out right now.
